Mac OS X CompCoind build instructions
Laszlo Hanyecz <solar@heliacal.net>

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building CompCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5 and 10.6 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone git@github.com:rat4/CompCoin.git CompCoin

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

2a. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build CompCoind:

cd CompCoin/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./CompCoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./CompCoind -daemon # to start the CompCoin daemon.
Run
  ./CompCoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands


Static Builds
-------------

./configure -release -opensource -confirm-license -static -no-sql-sqlite -no-opengl -qt-zlib -no-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -no-openssl -no-dbus -no-audio-backend -nomake examples


Troubleshooting
---------------

ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 
* Uninstall boost from macports 
* Install boost from homebrew


find /usr -name "boost"
